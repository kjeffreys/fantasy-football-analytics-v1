# Fantasy Football Analytics Project

A personal project to develop a **Python-based analytics and ML pipeline** for fantasy football. The goal is to explore NFL data, generate insights, and eventually predict player performance. This project also serves as a showcase for **DevOps best practices**, including Docker, CI/CD, and potentially cloud deployments.

## Overview

This repository contains scripts, configuration files, and other resources to:

- **Ingest** real or sample NFL datasets (e.g., CSV or API-based data).
- **Analyze** player and team statistics, producing insights for fantasy football enthusiasts.
- **Experiment** with predictive modeling (machine learning) for weekly player performance.
- **Demonstrate** DevOps practices: containerization (Docker), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), and (eventually) infrastructure-as-code for cloud deployment.

**Long-Term Vision**: Build a robust analytics engine that processes NFL (and possibly college) game video data with advanced AI, delivering best-in-class projections and insights for fantasy football.

## Project Goals

1. **Hands-On DevOps Learning**  
   - Dockerize the application.  
   - Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions, later possibly Terraform + AWS).

2. **Data Analysis & ML**  
   - Start with basic stats (yards per pass, top QBs, etc.).  
   - Progress to more advanced ML algorithms (scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.).  
   - Eventually integrate image/video processing (OpenCV, AWS Rekognition, etc.) if feasible.

3. **Demonstrable MVP**  
   - Provide meaningful stats or predictions to friends/family in a simple local or web-based UI.  
   - Potentially host a beta version in the cloud (e.g., AWS free tier).

4. **Scalable Side Hustle**  
   - Over time, expand features and explore monetization (blog, podcast, premium analytics, etc.).

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python (3.10+)
- **Data & ML**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` (initially)
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI), (future) AWS/Terraform
- **Database**: Local CSV/SQLite for now (optionally PostgreSQL with Docker Compose)
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose or Kubernetes (later phases)
