# Tests Directory

This directory contains all the tests for the Fantasy Football Analytics project. The tests are organized to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the project's codebase.

## Structure

The tests are organized into the following subdirectories:

- `unit/`: Contains unit tests for individual functions and classes.
- `integration/`: Contains integration tests that verify the interaction between different parts of the system.
- `functional/`: Contains functional tests that verify the functionality of the system as a whole.
- `e2e/`: Contains end-to-end tests that simulate real user scenarios to ensure the entire application works as expected.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command from the root directory of the project:

```sh
pytest
```

This command will execute all tests in the `tests/` directory.

## Writing Tests

When adding new tests, follow these guidelines:

- Place unit tests in the `unit/` directory.
- Place integration tests in the `integration/` directory.
- Place functional tests in the `functional/` directory.
- Place end-to-end tests in the `e2e/` directory.
- Use descriptive names for test files and functions.
- Ensure each test is independent and can run in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies where necessary to avoid flaky tests.

## Test Framework

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the test framework. Refer to the pytest documentation for more details on writing and running tests.

## Example Test File

Here is an example of a unit test file:

```python
# filepath: /home/kyle/repos/fantasy-football-analytics-v1/tests/unit/test_example.py

from src.example import example_function

def test_example_function():
    result = example_function()
    assert result == 'expected value'
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the project, ensure that all new code is covered by tests and that all existing tests pass. Run the tests locally before submitting a pull request.
